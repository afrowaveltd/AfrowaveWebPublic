    Overview of the Afrowave Community

The Afrowave Community is an open-source project that provides free-to-use services. Our services include (but are not limited to):

- Afrowave ID: An authentication and authorization system similar to OAuth, used across Afrowave projects and available for external community projects.
- Chat applications and social media platforms.
- News blogs and other media sharing platforms.
- Multilingual support for users around the world.

Premium services, such as sending text messages (SMS) or other services involving external costs, may be offered in the future. Charges for these services will only cover their associated expenses (e.g., hosting, SMS fees).
