**Afrowave is not just a community, it is the society.**  
Welcome to the official open-source repository of the Afrowave community.

Afrowave is an open, privacy-respecting, and people-driven initiative aiming to bring people together through freedom, creativity, and secure digital tools. We are a society of contributors from around the world, building safe, user-first software with full transparency and zero data tracking. No third-party corporate integrations. No hidden surveillance. Just community.

---

## 🔒 Privacy by Principle

The Afrowave platform will **never** collect or track user data.  
We do **not** integrate with third-party services (such as social login providers) that compromise user privacy.  
This is a key foundation of our community — we build for each other, and **we define our own standards of safety**.

---

## 🌍 Vision & Goals

Afrowave welcomes anyone who shares the vision of an open, free, and united digital society. Whether you're a developer, designer, translator, or just curious — you can contribute.

Key goals of the project include:

- Secure identity management
- Distributed and customizable community tools
- Multi-language support and decentralized email communication
- Easy-to-use installation and onboarding processes

---

## 🧩 Current Project: `Id` – The Authenticator

The first service under construction is the **Afrowave Authenticator** (`Id`).  
This modular identity platform is built to support:

- ✅ User & application management  
- ✅ Community brand registration  
- ✅ Visual style coordination  
- ✅ Auto-translation engine (multi-language UI)  
- ✅ Email engine with SMTP support, templates, and mass mailing

All setup steps are handled by a **10-step installation wizard**, launched automatically if no config file or required data is found.  
Upon first run, the app will:

1. Detect missing setup
2. Guide the user through configuration
3. Create the database (supports SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB/MySQL, SQLite)
4. Seed required data and translations
5. Generate admin account

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** ASP.NET (.NET 8)
- **Frontend:** Razor Pages, JavaScript, HTML, SCSS
- **Database Providers:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB (MySQL), SQLite
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core (with automatic migration support)

> Contributions in **other languages and frameworks** are welcome — as long as they use the public API to communicate with Afrowave services.
